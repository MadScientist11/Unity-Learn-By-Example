## Resources that were helpful to me
1. [Frey Holmer](https://www.youtube.com/@Acegikmo)<br />
She has very good series on math, editor scripting and shaders. It's a perfect place to start learning any of the topics.
2. [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/)<br />
This is the best book to learn the mathematics required for 3D and 2D game programming.
